# Traffic-Management-System
**This Is project of Traffic Management System Using Python and Machine Learning**
*The Intelligent Traffic Monitoring System is a comprehensive Project aimed to leveraging computer vision technique to enhance traffic management and monitoring.
*The System Employs OpenCV for real-time vehicle detection and tracking,coupled with data visualizaition using matplotlib for historical analysis.
*The Project focuses on counting vehicles as they cross a designated line,estimating their speed, and visualizing the time-series data for actionable insights.
